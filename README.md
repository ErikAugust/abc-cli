# abc-cli

This is a command-line script I put together in TypeScript to help my daughter learn where the keys are on the keyboard. It plays the associated note from the famous melody "Ah vous dirais-je, Maman" by Bouin.

The piano note recordings are courtesy of http://theremin.music.uiowa.edu/MISpiano.html. This is my reference: https://colormemozart.com/abcs-the-alphabet-song-piano-notes/.

Please note it only probably works on macOS due to its usage of `afplay`.

## Quick start
`npm install`

`npm run build`

`npm run start`
